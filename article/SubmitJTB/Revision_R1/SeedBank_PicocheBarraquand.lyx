\begin_layout Abstract
Seed formation is part of the reproductive cycle, leading to the accumulation
 of resistance stages that can withstand harsh environmental conditions
 for long periods of time.
 At the community level, multiple species with such long-lasting life stages
 can be more likely to coexist.
 While the implications of this process for biodiversity have been studied
 in terrestrial plants, seed banks are usually neglected in phytoplankton
 multispecies dynamic models, in spite of widespread empirical evidence
 for such seed 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631005696
(or rather cyst) 
\change_unchanged
banks.
 In this study, we build a metacommunity model of interacting phytoplankton
 species
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631006009
, including a resting stage 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631006213
 with
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631006215
supplying
\change_unchanged
 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631006219

cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631005700
seed
\change_unchanged
 bank.
 The model is parameterized with empirically-driven growth rate functions
 and field-based interaction estimates, which include both facilitative
 and competitive interactions.
 Exchanges between compartments (coastal pelagic cells, coastal 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631005766
cysts
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631005769
resting cells
\change_unchanged
 on the seabed, and open ocean pelagic cells) are controlled by hydrodynamical
 parameters to which the sensitivity of the model is assessed.
 We consider two models, i.e., with and without a saturating effect of the
 interactions on the growth rates.
 Our results are consistent between models, and show that a 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631005844
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631005845
seed
\change_unchanged
 bank allows to maintain all species in the community over 30 years.
 Indeed, a fraction of the species are vulnerable to extinction at specific
 times within the year, but this process is buffered by their survival in
 
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631006263
their resting stage
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631006258
the coastal cyst bank
\change_unchanged
.
 We thus highlight the potential role of the 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631006267
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631006267
seed
\change_unchanged
 bank in the recurrent re-invasion of the coastal community, and of coastal
 environments in re-seeding oceanic regions.
 Moreover, the 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631006277
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631006278
seed
\change_unchanged
 bank enables populations to tolerate stronger interactions within the community
 as well as more severe changes in the environment, such as those predicted
 within a climate change context.
 Our study therefore shows how a 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631006285
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631006285

 stage may help phytoplanktonic diversity maintenance.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How the high biodiversity of primary producers maintains is still an unresolved
 question for both experimental and theoretical ecology.
 Terrestrial plants and phytoplanktonic communities can present hundreds
 of species relying on similar resources, a situation where Gause's principle
 implies that a handful of species should outcompete the others.
 Some degree of niche differentiation, perhaps hidden to the human observer,
 is generally expected for coexistence to maintain

 However, a complex life-history structure can further increase the likelihood
 of coexistence

 It has been shown to arise when a long-lived dormant stage combines with
 temporal variation in recruitment from this stage and interspecific competition

 However, the contribution of seeds to coexistence may be much larger than
 their potential contribution to the storage effect.
 A long-lived seed bank can help coexistence by other, simpler means.
 For instance, in the meta-community model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, when dormancy and dispersal are present (without seed dispersal), local
 diversity increases in temporally fluctuating environments.
 In their model, adding a dormant stage could increase species diversity
 both at the local and regional scales.
 These results suggest that considering a seed stage in dynamical models
 can profoundly alter our understanding of community persistence

Although there is some awareness of the role of cryptic life stages in shaping
 terrestrial plant coexistence, the effect of such dormant life stages on
 aquatic plant communities, and more specifically that of phytoplanktonic
 algae, is often ignored.

 but also for harmful algae blooms (HAB) that can have strong negative impacts
 on aquatic ecosystems.
 
\change_unchanged
The classical view behind phytoplankton dynamics is that their blooms (peaks
 in abundances several orders of magnitude above their baseline level) are
 due to seasonal variation in light, temperature and nutrients, as well
 as hydrodynamic processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In this mindset, differential responses to environmental signals ensure
 the coexistence of multiple species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, while always assuming that vegetative cells are already present in the
 environment, or immigrating from a nearby water mass.
 Momentary disappearances of a species are viewed as sampling issues at
 low density.
 However, a complementary hypothesis suggests that resuspension and germination
 of phytoplanktonic resting cells
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631006385
, or cysts
\change_unchanged
, is another major player allowing re-invasion from very low or locally

 A variety of models have endeavoured to explain and predict amplitude,
 timing and/or spatial distribution of blooms by explicitly modeling multiple
 stages in the life cycle of a particular species, but without interactions
 with other organisms (see for example

 from the sea bottom, something that is impossible in the deep ocean.
 Moreover, `horizontal' exchanges between oceanic and coastal pelagic phytoplank

 A flow from the ocean to coastal communities has been noticed for dinoflagellat

The Beverton-Holt (BH) formulation of multispecies population dynamics,
 sometimes called Leslie-Gower 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cushing2004some"

\end_inset

, is a Lotka-Volterra competition equivalent for discrete-time models, and
 is often used to represent terrestrial plant community dynamics.
 In our implementation of the model, the maximum achievable growth rate
 is modified by both competitive and facilitative interactions, which translates
 into positive and negative 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ij}$
\end_inset

 coefficients, respectively.
 We present two different interaction models.
 We first use the classical multispecies BH model (model I, eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, the high number of facilitative interactions characterizing the
 modeled phytoplankton community 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 combined to the mass-action assumption could have very irrealistic destabilizin

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

: populations grow to infinity because there is no saturation of beneficial
 effects when density increases.
 In model I, we therefore forbid the realized growth rate to go above the
 intrinsic growth rate (its theoretical limit), by setting a minimum value
 of 1 to the denominator of the BH formulation.
 We subsequently define saturating interactions, inspired by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "qian_balance_2020"

\end_inset

, in our model II (eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 Model II provides a more process-orientated solution to the issue of excessive
 mutual benefaction (but at the cost of added parameters).

 First estimates of interaction coefficients are inferred from a previous

 models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in two parts: the species-independent metabolism part

The metabolism part describes the maximum achievable intrinsic growth rate
 based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This maximum daily intrinsic growth rate is weighted by the daylength 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 as no growth occurs at night.
 The niche part 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}(T)$
\end_inset

 describes the decrease in growth rate due to the difference between the
 temperature in the environment and the species-specific thermal optimum
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}^{opt}$
\end_inset

, and is controlled by the species-specific thermal decay 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$

 Parameterisation is further detailed in Section S1 of the SI.

 Indeed, the half-saturation coefficients

 vary between species, as opposed to the maximum rates in

 It did not make sense biologically for

 to be fixed (e.g., in a resource competition context, different species are
 expected to feel resource limitations at different concentrations of nutrients
 and at different numbers of competitors).

burial by sedimentation is the prevailing phenomenon.
 Indeed, once

 have been buried, they are not accessible for resuspension even if they
 could still germinate.
 Burial depends on the hydrodynamics of the site, but also on biotic processes
 (i.e., bioturbation) and anthropogenic disturbances such as fishing or leisure
 activities (e.g., jet skiing).
 This parameter is thus heavily dependent on the environmental context and
 varies here between 0.001 and 0.1 per day.

, we assume a temperature threshold: germination is triggered by temperatures
 going above 15°C.
 As actual rates of germination are not easily deduced from the literature,
 a set of credible values has been tested (1%, 0.1%, 0.01%).
 Similarly, resuspension values are seldom computed for phytoplanktonic
 cells, but models for inorganic particles can be used (see Section S3 of
 the SI for literature and details).
 In this paper, we explore values between

Phytoplankton dynamics

\begin_layout Standard
The classical mass-action (model I) and saturating interaction (model II)
 formulations of multispecies dynamics both reproduced the main characteristics
 of observed phytoplankton dynamics.
 They produced one or two blooms during the year and a range of abundances
 covering several orders of magnitude, with the right timing of the blooms.
 At the Auger site that was used for calibration, abundances increase in
 spring and can last over part of summer, or start a new bloom in autumn,
 which is what we observed as well in the models.
 Annual mean abundance of the various

 values (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 As parameters were varied in their plausible range, the average change
 in mean abundance on the coast between the reference simulation and the
 sensitivity simulations varied between -4.6 and 1.9% for model I and between
 -4.2 and 1.1% for model II, with similar deviations (same sign and magnitude)
 in the two models.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The only parameter that led to a substantially different results between
 the two models was the resuspension parameter (leading to a different value
 of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) which, when decreased, led to an increase in abundance of approximately
 1.9% in model I while it was only 0.9% in model II.
 [F: this is really mostly detail, can be removed.]
\end_layout

\end_inset

In the two models, the decrease in mortality rate of vegetative cells 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 had the highest impact on the final average abundance, leading to an increase
 in abundances.
 The exchange rate between the ocean and the coast had much less effect
 on the coastal average abundance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the amplitude (i.e., decimal logarithm of the maximum to
 minimum ratio of abundance) was more affected by changes in parameters
 and could vary by -39.4 to 18.6% in model I, and between -41.2% and 23% in
 model II.
 Results were qualitatively the same in the two models, with a decrease

In three cases (

 or exchange rate set to 0), the final richness of the oceanic community
 decreased from 11 to 4.
 Extant species were the same in all simulations (CHA, THP, NIT, PSE

 S3 of the SI

 When resuspension was set to 0.001, a species periodically disappeared from
 the ocean, to be subsequently re-seeded by the coastal population.

For all parameters, except the sinking rate, an increase in mean abundance
 was associated to a decrease in amplitude.

 In both cases, it consisted in removing the

 mortality to 100% per day.
 Without any other disturbance to the system, this led to a decrease in
 richness from 11 to 4 species at the end of the simulation (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Seed_bank_compet"

\end_inset

) while the total abundance of phytoplankton was not strongly affected (around
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{5}$
\end_inset

 in all cases).
 The inverse of the Simpson index (the second Hill number) decreased from
 approximately 3 to 1, showing that the disappearance of the 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631019433
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631019433

Biotic effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first hypothesis was that the absence of the 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631019438
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631019438

\change_unchanged
 bank would cause the community to be more affected by a higher competition
 strength.
 Counter-intuitively, our results (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Seed_bank_compet"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) showed that an increase in competition strength only had negative effects
 with model I, and for high competition values (6 times the reference ones
 at least), shifting from 4 to 3 species in the oceanic compartment of a
 community without 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631019518
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631019529
a seed
\change_unchanged
 bank.
 By contrast, an increase in competition strength did not affect the richness
 of a community with a 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631019532
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631019532
seed
\change_unchanged
 bank.
 On the contrary, a decrease in competition (from a factor 0.5 and lower)
 or an increase in facilitation (starting from a factor 2 and higher) led
 to much smaller communities in model II in the absence of a 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631019539

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Richness was lowest when competition was divided by 6 or when facilitation
 was multiplied by 8 in model II.
 The same pattern (richness stability with model I, sensitivity to a decrease
 in competition or an increase in facilitation with model II) was observed
 in a community with a 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631019551
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631019551

\change_unchanged
 bank, but for larger disturbances.
 Competition indeed had to be at least divided by 6 or facilitation, to
 be multiplied by 7 for richness to decrease to 9 species.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inverse of the Simpson index was also affected by the changes in interaction
 strengths, with similar patterns to richness, as it was lowest for high
 facilitation or low competition.
 Presumably some species reach very high growth rates in these scenarios,
 which then feeds back onto community dynamics, generating lower diversity
 in the end.

 In all cases however, the total abundances were not strongly affected.
 Indeed, the total abundance of a community is driven by a small number
 of numerically dominant species, which did not disappear.
 High total abundances tended to correspond to the abundance of only one
 or two species.
 Model II consistenly led to higher abundances, as was already the case
 in the reference simulations.

\begin_layout Standard
Using a meta-community model which accounts for exchanges between the ocean
 and the coast, as well as movements between the top and the bottom of the
 coastal water column, we were able to show that 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631020134
a specific life stage, the seed – or cyst –
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631020141

\change_unchanged
stage
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631020152
, when dormant cells are stored in a seed bank
\change_unchanged
, can help maintain biodiversity.
 This dormant stage was integrated to a phytoplanktonic community dynamics
 model, which was parameterized based on literature, field-based phenology,
 and interaction strength estimates.
 The model was then calibrated on phytoplankton community time series.
 Our model was able to simulate realistic community dynamics (both mean
 abundances and temporal patterns), while including the effects of both
 positive and negative interactions on community dynamics.
 When removing the 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631020170
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631020170
seed
\change_unchanged
 bank, biodiversity decreased drastically.
 This was true for the reference parameter values, as well as when species
 interaction strengths and environmental fluctuation levels where altered,
 in which cases the 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1631020183
cyst
\change_inserted -2100369821 1631020183
seed
\change_unchanged
 bank's buffering influence disappeared.
 The total abundance of the community decreased as well.
 Moreover, when faced with a biotic or abiotic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

press
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 perturbation, communities where species could divert part of their population
 to a dormant stage were less prone to species loss and could maintain their
 biomass through the years.
 These results were consistent for the two interaction models that we considered
, with and without progressive saturation in interaction strengths

 In our case, our focus on phytoplankton led us to assume that organisms
 moved between the coast and the ocean, which were largely synchronous environme
nts.
 Spatial recolonization was therefore less important than temporal recolonizatio
n; the relative importance of the two processes may vary depending on the
 organisms and the degree of spatial synchrony of their environment

 This would be true for most plants too (and perhaps some phytoplankters

Species persistence varied between the coastal and ocean compartment.
 Temporary species disparition could happen periodically in the ocean but
 species were able to reinvade the coast thanks to the connection to the
 seed bank, and then reinvaded the ocean from there.

Survival probabilities of species within the community in the absence of

 extinctions, as well as a smaller niche width (i.e., being a specialist)

 Other species periodically disappeared from the community in the open ocean,

 Certain species characteristics could explain species extinction, whether
 definitive or only temporary: higher amplitudes of population variation
 were typically associated with extinctions.
 We identified, by studying realised population growth rates (Fig.
 S7 in SI), that a smaller niche width (i.e., being a specialist) or being
 strongly affected by species interactions can explain rapid extinction
 without a cyst bank.

Despite the evidence for seed bank effects that we and others uncovered,
 phytoplanktonic community models designed to explain biodiversity usually
 avoid modelling seed

 banks.
 In our view, this may decrease the possibility of spontaneous re-colonization
 at the coast (at very low densities initially), which can then spill to
 the open ocean by progressive dispersal by the currents.
 If the goal of a community-level model is very short-term prediction (days,
 weeks), this recolonization can probably be neglected.
 However, over multiple years, ignoring cryptic stages allowing recolonization
 could strongly bias our view of long-term coexistence.
 Long-term phytoplankton coexistence modelling (over multiple decades or
 more) likely requires that we take into account

When modelling different stages of the life cycle in a detailed manner –
 as done here – is impractical, the recolonization could perhaps be simplified
 to a stochastic immigration term (as done in

More research on dormant stages may be needed to parameterize truly predictive
 mechanistic phytoplankton models with multiple life stages, in particular
 to inform parameters such as the sinking rate of resting cells, as well
 as burial and resuspension parameters.

 Sinking rates show an interesting conflict between short- and long-term
 survival: in coastal areas, a fraction of sinking cells contribute to the

 But high sinking rates are essentially

 Many factors may contribute: bottom currents, benthic animals, ...
 We therefore encourage both experiments and field observations to follow
 actual seed trajectories, in order to help us understand this cryptic part
 of the diversity maintenance process.
