\begin_layout Title
A metacommunity model for phytoplankton biodiversity maintenance with a
 seed bank and facilitative interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Seed formation is part of the reproductive cycle, leading to the accumulation
 of resistance stages that can withstand harsher environmental conditions
 for long periods of time.
 At the community scale, multiple species with such long-lasting life stages
 can be more likely to coexist thanks to seeds' buffering effect.
 While the implications of this process for biodiversity have been studied
 in terrestrial plants, seed (or cyst) banks are usually neglected in phytoplank
ton multispecies models, in spite of widespread empirical evidence for such
 cyst banks.
 In this study, we build a metacommunity model of interacting phytoplankton
 species with a cyst bank.
 The model is parameterized with empirically-driven growth rates functions
\change_deleted -2100369821 1601370715
,
\change_inserted -2100369821 1601370715
 and
\change_unchanged
 field-based interaction estimates (which include both facilitative and
 competitive interactions).
 Exchanges between compartments (coastal pelagic individuals, the cyst bank,
 and open ocean pelagic individuals) are controlled by hydrodynamical parameters
 to which the sensitivity of the model is assessed.
 We consider two models, i.e., with and without a saturating effect of the
 interactions on the growth rates.
 Our results are consistent between models, and show that a cyst bank is
 necessary to maintain all species in the community over 30 years.
 Indeed, the life histories of certain species make them more vulnerable
 to extinction at specific times within a year, but this process is buffered
 by their survival in the coastal cyst bank and re-invasion of the community.
 We thus highlight the possible role of coastal environments in re-seeding
 oceanic regions.
 Moreover, the cyst bank enables populations to tolerate stronger interactions
 within the community as well as more severe changes in the environment,
 such as those predicted within a climate change context.
 This study therefore uncovers the importance of the phytoplanktonic cyst
 stage for diversity maintenance, which should inspire further investigations
 of this life stage.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How the high biodiversity of primary producers maintains is still an unresolved
 question for both experimental and theoretical ecology.
 Terrestrial plants and phytoplanktonic communities can present hundreds
 of species relying on similar resources, a situation where Gause's principle
 implies that a handful of species should outcompete the others.
 Some degree of niche differentiation, perhaps hidden to the human observer,
 is generally expected for coexistence to maintain

 However, complex life-history structure can further increase the likelihood
 of coexistence

 nonadditive growth rates with 'life history traits' such as iteroparity,

 seed bank formation with dormance.
 They then turn to a general model with two examples: lottery model and

Models of coexistence in plant communities often acknowledge the effect
 of demographic processes on several distinct life stages.
 Even models considering a single life-stage may need to account implicitly
 for processes taking place in another: seed dispersal and germination,
 in models of the spatial distribution of adult plants (e.g., Martorell and
 Freckleton 2014), or density-dependent adult reproduction for seed models
 (Levine and Rees 2004).
 The seed stage stands out as it is instrumental to dispersal, accumulation
 in seed banks, entering dormancy for several generations, and germination
 to re-invade the environment when favorable conditions returns.
 Species-specific reproduction strategies (e.g., high numbers of seeds and
 low survivorship vs low reproduction investment and high survivorship)
 introduce niche differences which can stabilize coexistence (Ellner 1987,
 Chesson et al.
 2000, 2018

).
 At the local scale, dormancy enables organisms to endure harsher environmental
 conditions than they would as adults.
 This can impact the population dynamics of a species (by stabilizing it
 , as in Pacala 1986, or modifying its growth rate, as shown in Nguyen et
 al.
 2019) and allow species with fragile vegetative states to remain present
 and to re-invade communities (Aikio et al.
 2002, Angert et al.
 2009).
 At the meta-community-level, dispersal, environmental buffering and colonizatio
n can maintain diversity by spatially segregating species (Shmida and Ellner
 1984

Even though different coexistence mechanisms have been unveiled through
 the use of several life stages and a focus on the youngest stage (seeds)
 for terrestrial plants, the effect of life cycles on aquatic plants communities
, and more specifically that of phytoplanktonic algae, is often ignored.
 The classical view behind phytoplankton dynamics is that blooms (peaks
 in abundances that can cover several orders of magnitude) are due to seasonal
 variation in light, temperature and nutrients, as well as hydrodynamics
 processes (Reynolds 2006).
 In this scenario, differential responses to environmental signals ensure
 the coexistence of multiple species (Margalef 1978, Smayda and Reynolds
 2001), assuming that vegetative cells are already present in the environment
 and can duplicate enough to reach high abundances.
 However, a complementary hypothesis suggests that resuspension and germination
 of phytoplanktonic resting cells, or cysts

 which confirm that life history strategies including dormant cysts are
 widespread in phytoplankton.
 A variety models have endeavoured to explain and predict amplitude, timing
 and/or spatial distribution of blooms by explicitly modeling multiple stages
 in the life cycle of a particular species, without interactions with other
 organisms (see for example McGillicuddy et al.
 2005, Yniguez et al.

Our model is parameterized from field data (growth and interaction rates),
 and includes biotic and abiotic constraints (e.g., particle sinking).
 In our analyses, we either add or remove the dormant compartment, which
 allows to pinpoint its contribution to coexistence.
 We find that the presence of cysts prevents the extinction of several species.
 Cyst banks also allow a community to maintain its richness even with strong
 disturbances of its interaction network, unless facilitative interactions
 completely eclipse competitive interactions.
 Changes in the environment, here represented by an increase in the mean
 temperature, can also be buffered by cysts banks.
 Finally, we discuss the importance of this often ignored life stage in
 phytoplanktonic demography and the information that would be required to
 further more accurate modeling of the cyst dynamics.

CP: Question remains on what we do for mutualistic interactions but I am
 not even sur I talk about that -> FB: One problem at the time...
 CP: Also, I think we could drop this coefficient at once; or we need to
 add it in the saturating interaction model - just multiplying a_C ? I can
 find no reference for the assumption of a stronger competition in the ocean.
 It is certain that nutrients are scarcer, but can we necessarily conclude
 that competition is stronger? Differential responses to nutrients, stoichiometr
y/nutrient ratio (Sakshaug & Olsen 1986), nonlinear responses to nutrients
 (Marinov et al.
 2010), other elements such as competition or hydrodynamics (Hulburt et
 al.
 1970) seem too important to be able to find a satisfactory value out of
 nowhere for 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{c}2o$
\end_inset

.
 Insemination by metals are not satisfactory either (Mackey et al.
 2012) as increases in growth rates are not simply stronger in the ocean.
 Griffiths et al.
 (2015) could not find a stronger competition (actually found lower interactions
 between individuals).
 Moreover, if we want to talk about the effect of the seed bank, it might
 appear like

 This maximum daily growth rate is weighted by the daylength 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 as no growth occurs at night.
 The niche part 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}(T)$
\end_inset

 describes the decrease in growth rate due to the difference between the
 temperature in the environment and the taxon-specific thermal optimum 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{K,i}^{opt}$

 Indeed, the half-saturation coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{ij}$

 are here variable between species, since it did not make sense biologically
 for this quantity to be fixed (e.g., in a resource competition context, different
 species are expected to feel resource limitations at different concentrations
 of nutrients and at different number of competitors).

 might be a prevailing phenomenum in driving phytoplanktonic dynamics.
 Once cysts have been buried, they are not accessible for resuspension even
 if they could have germinated from an accessible location.
 Burial depends on the hydrodynamics of the site, but also on biotic processes
 (i.e., bioturbation) and anthropogenic disturbances such as fishing or leisure
 activities (e.g., jet skiing).
 This parameter is thus heavily dependent on the environmental context and
 varies here between 0.001 and 0.1 per day.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
About the time-series themselves: as we know, phytoplankton time-series
 contain many gaps.
 We can build different reference datasets: a raw dataset, with lots of
 missing values, and an interpolated dataset.
 Interpolation itself can be done in two ways: the crudest one is to use
 a direct interpolation, where all missing values, even for the longer gaps,
 are linearly interpolated.
 A more elaborate way, previously used with MAR models, is to only interpolate
 for a maximum of a month-gap, and to replace other missing values by a
 random value uniformly distributed between 0 and half the minimum value
 of the time-series.
 The raw dataset, and, more importantly, the crudely interpolated one, tend
 to overestimate the final abundances as the the smallest values are not
 observed while the second reconstructed dataset may underestimate them
 as it only attributes missing values as low, closer to 0 than observed,
 values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this manuscript, we use time-series to (a) extract the main patterns
 in the phenology of each species, including their bloom period and amplitude
 of their dynamics, (b) compute BH coefficients from the MAR coefficients,
 based on the 'equilibrium' value, i.e.
 the mean value over the time-series, and the maximum value for the saturating
 interactions and (c) compare the mean and amplitude of the simulated values
 to the observed ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Phenology (a) is based on a crudely interpolated dataset for each year (which
 means that there is no interpolation from one year to another.
 There are often many missing values at the boundaries of the year, due
 to abundance decrease and storms which do not allow monitoring).
 As we focus on blooming periods, high values are the most important.
 We must acknowledge the fact that we certainly miss oscillations in the
 bloom.
 Amplitudes (b and c) are also computed on this dataset to remain close
 to what is actually observed even though we can assume that actual lowest
 values are even lower than observed.
 Maximum values (b) are also extracted from the raw dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mean values (b and c) are based on the reconstructed time-series from Picoche
 et al.
 2020.
 We consider that the underestimation this could induce is smaller than
 the overestimation that would be due to using the average values from the
 raw dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This needs to be discussed as this also means we have choices to make for
 graphics: do we show the interpolated values or insist on the variability
 and show the raw dataset? IN this specific context, I would advocate for
 the second option.

 The classical Beverton-Holt (model I) and saturating interaction (model
 II) formulations both reproduced the main characteristics of phytoplanktonic
 dynamics.
 They produced one or two blooms during the year, with a range of abundances
 covering several orders of magnitude, with the right timing of these blooms.
 At the Auger site that was used for calibration, abundances increase in
 spring and can last over part of summer, or start a new bloom in autumn,
 which is what we obtained in the models.
 Annual mean abundance of the various taxa was also well reproduced.
 That said, in some cases abundances could be lower than expected and the
 variation in abundances due to seasonality was underestimated (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In all cases, saturating interactions led to higher abundances than mass-action

 As values varied in a plausible range, the average change in abundance
 on the coast between the reference simulation and the sensitivity simulations
 varied between -4.6 and 1.9% for model I and between -4.2 and 1.1% for model
 II, with similar deviations (same sign and magnitude) in the two models.
 The only parameter that led to a substantially different results between
 the two models was the resuspension parameter (leading to a different value
 of the parameter

) which, when decreased, led to an increase in abundance of approximately
 1.9% in model I while it was only 0.9% in model II.
 In the two models, the decrease in mortality rate of vegetative cells 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 had the more impact of the final average abundance, leading to an increase
 in abundances.
 The exchange rate between the ocean and the coast had much less effect
 on the coastal average abundance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the decimal logarithm of the maximum to minimum ratio
 of abundance (i.e., the order of magnitude of the range of abundances for
 each taxa) was more affected by changes in parameters and could vary by
 -39.4 to 18.6% in model I, and between -41.2% and 23% in model II.
 Results were qualitatively the same in the two models, with a decrease
 in cyst burial being the main driver of the decrease in amplitude, and
 a decrease in resuspension leading to an increase in amplitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In three cases (cyst burial rate set to 0.1, resuspension to 10

 from 11 to 4.
 Extant taxa were the same in all simulations (CHA, THP, NIT, PSE).

 from the ocean, to be subsequently re-seeded by the coastal population.

Our first hypothesis was that the absence of the cyst bank would cause the
 community to be more affected by higher competition.
 Counter-intuitively, our results (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Seed_bank_compet"

\end_inset

) showed that an increase in competition only had negative effect with model
 I and for high competition values (6 times the reference ones at least),
 shifting from 4 taxa to 3 taxa in the oceanic compartment of a community
 without cyst bank while it did not affect the richness of a community with
 a cyst bank.
 On the contrary, a decrease in competition (from a factor 0.5 and lower)
 or an increase in facilitation (starting from a factor 2 and higher) led
 to much smaller communities in model II, sometimes with a total competitive
 exclusion

 Richness was lowest when competition was divided by 6 or when facilitation
 was multiplied by 8 in model II.
 The same pattern (richness stability with model I, sensitivity to a decrease
 in competition or an increase in facilitation with model II) was observed
 in a community with a cyst bank, but for larger disturbances.
 Competition indeed had to be at least divided by 6 or facilitation, to
 be multiplied by 7 for richness to decrease to 9 taxa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geometric mean abundance was also affected by such biotic changes.
 The order of magnitude of the average abundance without a cyst bank varied
 between a -1.4 and -2.8 with model I and between -1.3 and -3.3 with model II,
 while it was between 34.4 and 1.4 for model I and between 0.7 and 3.3 for model
 II with a cyst bank.
 It should be noted that model I was able to produce much higher abundances
 when competition was low, which can be related to the presence of a hard
 threshold on the amplifying effect of the interactions on the growth rate.

Our second hypothesis was that the absence of a cyst bank would reduce the

 by variation in the temperature.

, this was true for both models, as the communities without a cyst bank
 could not maintain their richness with an increase in temperature above
 2°C, as opposed to communities with a cyst bank, which could only be affected
 by a 7°C increase (scenario SSP5 8.5).
 In all cases however, the total abundances were not strongly affected.
 Indeed, the total abundance of a community is driven by a small number
 of numerically dominant taxa, which did not disappear.
 High total abundances tended to correspond to the abundance of only one
 or two taxa.
 Model II consistenly led to higher abundances, as was already the case
 in the reference simulations.

Our results demonstrate the major role of phytoplanktonic cyst banks in
 maintaining biodiversity, as has already been evidenced by theoretical
 models for other taxa such as plants (Levine and Rees 2004), invertebrates

 or microbes (Jones and Lennon 2010).
 Dormancy has been observed in field and experimental data, including for
 phytoplanktonic organisms (Eilersten and Wyatt 2000), and has long been
 thought to be an important and neglected process in the wider microbiology
 literature (Locey 2010, Lennon and Jones 2011).
 Processes behind diversity maintenance by the seed stage include the storage
 effect (Bonis et al.
 1995, Facelli et al.
 2005, Angert et al.
 2009) but may also depend on other mechanisms such as niche differentiation
 through alternative life strategies (Ellner et al.
 1987, [[Find a more recent pper]]) or resistance to fluctuating environments
 (Brink et al.
 2020).
 This is especially true when organisms are also able to disperse between
 patches in addition to dormancy (Shmida and Ellner 1984, XXX).
 In our case, phytoplanktonic organisms moved between the coast and the
 ocean which were subject to synchronous environments.
 Contrary to most dormancy/dispersal literature (but see Wisknoski et al.
 2019), only vegetative organisms were able to disperse.
 Differing assumptions however did not change the same general conclusion:
 the combination of seed banks, dispersal and dormancy helps greatly biodiversit
y maintenance.
 Such results are also robust to changes in exchange parameters and mean
 interaction values in the community.
 Hence, possible small differences between our model and true field-based
 interactions (even after the calibration process used here) are unlikely
 to change any of the main results regarding the diversity and composition
 of the community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -2100369821 1604575361
Species present in the community had different survival probabilities in
 the absence of a seed bank.
 Some species could only survive with a seed bank (which confirms conclusions
 from Hellweger et al.
 2008 for single species).
 Others periodically disappeared from the community in the ocean, while
 being able to reinvade the coast from the seed bank, which could be linked
 to the notion of locally transient species which are filtered out from
 certain patches but can reinvade the environment (Guittar et al.
 2020).
 The same life history traits could explain species extinction, whether
 definitive or only temporary: higher amplitudes of variation were the most
 prominent one.
 In our model, the sensitivity of the growth rate, and therefore variation
 in biomasses, is due to a higher sensitivity to temperature variation.
 Species are more prone to crash, and sometimes do so before being able
 to build a seed bank sufficient for them to reinvade.
 More generally, smaller niche width (due to, e.g., sensitivity to nutrient
 availability, tolerance to predation) can explain such rapid extinction.

Phytoplanktonic community models often lack a seed bank compartment.
 However, we showed that we explain diversity much better with a seed bank
 in a model calibrated on real data.
 Taking into account the possibility of spontaneous re-colonization from
 the coast to the ocean may be as important as accounting for re-seeding
 of vegetative organisms by the ocean.
 Therefore, we may want to add this process in more long-term models for
 the coexistence of phytoplanktonic species, as done more frequently for
 flower plants.
 When modelling different stages of the life cycle as done here is impractical,
 it could perhaps be simplified as a stochastic immigration term (as done
 in Stock et al.
 2005, who focus on a single species).
 More research on dormant stages may be needed to parameterize truly predictive
 mechanistic models, in particular to inform parameters such as the sinking
 rate of resting cells, burial, resuspension.
 These parameters are all linked to the hydrodynamics processes (Yamamoto
 et al.
 2002, 2003, Yniguez et al.
 2012) and may need to be calibrated for each modeled site.
 In simpler, phenomenological models, we may need more data to better pinpoint
 at which frequency we can consider seed bank reinvasion with field or experimen
tal data – currently one of the only parameters measured is the rate of
 survival of the cells found in the sediment (Montresor et al.
 2013, Solow et al.
 2014).
 Other parameters such as transition rates are however missing (Estrada
 et al.
 2010).
 We therefore encourage both experiments and field observation to follow
 seed trajectories to inform models with biological and physical forcing
 to explain cyst bank dynamics, therefore also explaining part of diversity
 maintenance.
