# Phytoplankton community dynamic model with a seed bank

This repository contains the data, code and analyses of a phytoplankton metacommunity model including a seed bank. We (Frédéric Barraquand & Coralie Picoche) show that modeling the seed stage in phytoplankton life histories can help understand the coexistence of multiple species despite competition. 

The folder is organized as follow:

* `article` is self-explanatory
* `output`: contains the figure from the scripts in `script`, mostly related to the phenology of species. It also contains the scripts and results of the calibration of the two models developed in the paper 
* `param`: contains the time series from the example site + parameters for the models
* `script`: contains all scripts for both models and calibration/parameterisation of the model
