# Phytoplankton community dynamics model with a seed bank

This repository contains the data, code and analyses of a phytoplankton metacommunity model including a seed bank. We (Frédéric Barraquand & Coralie Picoche) show that modeling the seed stage in phytoplankton life histories can promote the coexistence of multiple species despite competition. 

The folder is organized as follow:

* `article` is self-explanatory
* `output` contains most figures related to the phenology of species. It also contains the scripts and results of the calibration of the interactions of the model used in the manuscript. 
* `param` contains the data from the example site (time series of the abundances and temperatures + interaction matrix), as well as the parameters used in the model.
* `script` contains scripts for the calibration of the phenology, as well as the scripts for the main figures (and corresponding simulations) in `script/common_scripts`.
