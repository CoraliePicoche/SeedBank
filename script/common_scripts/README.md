This folder contains used for the main analyses of the manuscript. 

* `main_sensivity.r` runs the sensivity analysis.
* `no_seed_bank_compet.r` launches simulations with and without a seed bank when interaction strengths are varied. In `no_seed_bank_compet_keeping_intra.r`, the intraspecific interaction strengths are not modified while interspecific interactions strengths are.
* `no_seed_bank_temp.r` launches simulations with and without a seed bank varying mean and variance of the temperature. 
* `step_functions.r` contains the main functions for temperature-dependent growth rate and the two substeps of the model (growth and exchanges).
